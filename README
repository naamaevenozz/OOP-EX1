- WhateverPlayer: Chooses a random empty cell on the board for every move.
- NaivePlayer: Iterates through the board row by row, column by column,
 and plays in the first available empty cell it finds.
- SmartPlayer: Tries to win by completing
 a row/column/diagonal of its marks (size=4, winStreak=3). 
  If it cannot win this turn, it tries to block the opponent’s winning move. 
  If neither is possible, it plays strategically by prioritizing the center, then the corners, 
  and finally chooses a random empty cell.

All players implement the Player interface,
 which defines a single method: playTurn(Board board, Mark mark).
This allows the Game and Tournament classes to interact with any type of player in the same way, 
without knowing its internal implementation. 

This design leverages key Object-Oriented Programming concepts:
- **Encapsulation**: Each player hides its logic and internal state.
- **Abstraction**: The system only depends on the Player interface, not the implementation details.
- **Polymorphism**: The same method signature is used across all player types.
- **Information Hiding**: The Game class doesn't need to know how a player decides its move.
- **Minimal API**: The Player interface only exposes what is strictly necessary.

No additional classes were added beyond those specified in the assignment instructions.
